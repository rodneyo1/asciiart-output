#ASCII Art Banner Generator

This program creates ASCII art banners from a provided string and an optional input file containing character sets.

##Features

    Accepts a string as input for the banner text.
    Supports loading character sets from a text file for improved control over the banner's appearance.
    Generates ASCII art banners in the specified output file (default: banner.txt).
    Validates input string to ensure it contains only printable characters (except newline \n).
    Handles basic formatting for newline (\n) and tab (\t) characters within the input string.

##Installation

    Make sure you have Go installed (https://go.dev/doc/install).
    Clone or download this repository.
    Navigate to the project directory then into the directory containing the main.go file /art in your terminal.

##Usage

There are two ways to use the program:

###1. With a String Input Only

`go run . "YOUR_STRING"`

This will create an ASCII art banner for the provided string and use the default character set from the built-in standard.txt file. The banner will be saved in banner.txt.

###2. With a String Input and an Optional Character Set File

`go run . -output OUTPUT_FILE_NAME STRING CHARACTER_SET_FILE.txt`

    Replace OUTPUT_FILE_NAME with the desired name for the output file (default: banner.txt).
    STRING is the text you want to convert into ASCII art.
    CHARACTER_SET_FILE.txt is the path to the text file containing your custom character set. This file should have one character per line.

##Character Set File Format

Each line in the character set file represents a single character that can be used in the banner. The first 8 lines define the top row of characters, the next 8 lines define the second row, and so on, creating a grid of characters. You can customize these characters to create unique banner styles.

Example Character Set File (standard.txt):

 _              _   _          
| |            | | | |         
| |__     ___  | | | |   ___   
|  _ \   / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  
| | | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) | 
|_| |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/  
                               
                               



##Limitations

    The program currently assumes the character set file is 8 characters wide and has 855 lines (8 x 107 characters). Modifying this layout might cause unexpected results.
    The program only accepts printable characters (except newline and tab) for the input string.

##Future Improvements

    Support additional formatting options for the input string.
